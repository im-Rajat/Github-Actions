# Github Actions

- GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) platform provided by GitHub.
- It allows developers to automate workflows directly within their repositories. 
- With GitHub Actions, you can define custom workflows using YAML files to automate tasks such as:
  - Building and testing code: Automatically run tests and builds when code is pushed or pull requests are created.
  - Deploying applications: Deploy code to production or staging environments.
  - Code analysis: Run linters, security scans, or other tools to ensure code quality.
  - Custom automation: Automate any task, such as sending notifications or managing issues.
